This is my First full game project called Invasion Defense.


Objective:
- Finish the project into full game from a Conept game that I made in Pythonista and transfer it to GDScript
- Implement new game mechanic like Dialogues, shop store, upgrades, etc
- Make it semi-finished game



Conclusion:
I learn alot when making this game for a year. This game was developed for a year, understanding SQLite further, Understanding complex game mechanic, and polish it as much as possible.
The game is not finish yet, but i am planning to finish it further once i learn more about optimization, more function management, database management, debugging and understanding deeper problems through the code.


My plan for this game isnt clear, but this maybe just another game concept but semi completed, and planning something in the future, or abandon it altogether.
